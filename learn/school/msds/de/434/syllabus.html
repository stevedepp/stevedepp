        Description: This course covers programming components essential to the development of analytics applications. The focus is analytics software engineering. Students learn to develop single- system/desktop solutions as well as client-server solutions. They learn about web-based, client- server solutions employing a variety of front-end and back-end system components. Students develop software, working on open-source programming, database, and systems integration projects. They employ best practices in software development.
        - <p>Develop analytics applications using a general purpose computer language that solve real-world business problems.</p>
        - <p>Use software development best practices to create analytics applications. These include test-driven development, continuous deployment, code quality tools, logging, instrumentation, and monitoring.</p>
        - <p>Use cloud-native technologies to build analytics applications. These include large-scale relational and non-relational databases, automated machine learning, cloud monitoring, and cloud-based virtual machines and application engines.</p>
        - <p>Use software development best practices to create analytics applications. These include test-driven development, continuous deployment, code quality tools, logging, instrumentation, and monitoring.</p>
        - <p>Differentiate among styles of analytics application development, including custom programming, automated model selection, and application programming interfaces to machine learning and artificial intelligence tools.</p>
        - <p>Build a data engineering REST service. Identify databases (relational, columnar, document, or graph-based) appropriate to various analytics applications.</p>
        - <p>Identify databases (relational, columnar, document, or graph-based) appropriate to various analytics applications.</p>
        - <p>Put a machine learning (ML) model into production.</p>
