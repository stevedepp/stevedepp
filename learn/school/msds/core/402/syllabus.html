        Description: This course introduces the field of data science, which combines business strategy, information technology, and analytic modeling. The course reviews applications and methods in data science, explores implementation and development of analytics in organizations, and introduces foundational concepts in data engineering. Students evaluate business problems and solutions in traditional and contemporary data management systems, selecting appropriate tools for data collection, preparation, warehousing, and analysis. The course culminates with students producing an original, professionally presented research plan that includes sampling and survey design for a contemporary research problem.
