        Description: The course introduces machine learning with business applications. It provides a survey of machine learning techniques, including traditional statistical methods, resampling techniques, model selection and regularization, tree-based methods, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, artificial neural networks, and deep learning. Students implement machine learning models with open-source software for data science. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification. Prerequisites: MSDS 400-DL Math for Data Scientists, MSDS 401-DL Applied Statistics with R, and MSDS 402-DL Introduction to Data Science.
