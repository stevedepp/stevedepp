        Description: This course introduces reinforcement learning as an approach to intelligent systems, emphasizing applications such as robotic processes automation, conversational agents and robotics that mimic human behavior. Students implement intelligent agents to solve both discrete- and continuous-valued sequential decision-making problems. Students develop, debug, train, visualize, and customize programs in a variety of learning environments. The course reviews Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, temporal difference learning, Monte Carlo reinforcement learning, eligibility traces, the role of function approximation, and the integration of learning and planning. This is a case study and project-based course with a substantial programming component.
        <p>- Implement business use cases using RPA and identify how RPA helps hyper automation.</p>
        <p>- Identify the use cases and business applications for reinforcement learning.</p>
        <p>- Differentiate between supervised, unsupervised learning from reinforcement learning.</p>
        <p>- Describe Intelligent Agents and be able to demonstrate the workings of it.</p>
        <p>- Interact with a conversational agent and explain the workings of an interactive chatbot.</p>
        <p>- Define the key features of reinforcement learning that distinguishes it from AI and non-interactive machine learning.</p>
        <p>- Implement RL algorithms such as a deep RL algorithm, including imitation learning.</p>
        <p>- Given an application problem (be able to determine if it should be formulated as an RL problem and state what algorithms are best suited for addressing it.</p>
        <p>- Describe multiple criteria for analyzing RL algorithms and evaluate algorithms on these metrics: e.g. regret, sample complexity, computational complexity, empirical performance, convergence, etc.</p>
        <p>- Compare at least two approaches for addressing the exploration vs exploitation challenge in terms of performance, scalability, complexity of implementation, and theoretical guarantees.</p>
