        Description: A review of specialized deep learning methods for vision, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Students work with raw image files, including digital representations of photographs, hand-written documents, x-rays, and sensor images. Students process image data, converting pixels into numeric tensors for subsequent analysis and modeling. The course illustrates real-world applications for visual exploration, discovery, and navigation, and for image classification, facial recognition, remote sensing, and medical diagnostics. This is a project-based course with extensive programming assignments.
        <p>- Decide on the appropriate level of abstraction for applying Computer Vision to a business problem.</p>
        <p>- Build computer vision models from scratch. These will include Tensorflow 2.0 based Deep Learning models.</p>
        <p>- Apply Computer Vision models to edge-based Machine Learning hardware. These will include Intel Movidius.</p>
        <p>- Apply Computer Vision models to edge-based Machine Learning hardware that work with Managed ML Systems. These will use AWS DeepLense and AWS Sagemaker.</p>
        <p>- Use Cloud-Native Computer Vision APIs.</p>
